# Whitelist dApp


This repository contains a decentralized application (dApp) for managing whitelists on the Ethereum blockchain. The Whitelist dApp allows users to create, manage, and verify whitelists, which are commonly used in various scenarios such as token sales, access control, and membership systems.

## Introduction

The Whitelist dApp provides an easy-to-use interface for managing whitelists in a decentralized manner. It leverages the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to ensure transparency, immutability, and secure management of whitelist data.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization.
- Whitelist creation: Users can create new whitelists and define the required criteria for inclusion.
- Whitelist management: Owners can add or remove addresses from their whitelists.
- Whitelist verification: Users can check whether an address is on a particular whitelist.
- Event tracking: The dApp tracks and displays the history of whitelist modifications.

## Installation

To run the Whitelist dApp locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies by running the command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and provide the necessary environment variables (such as Ethereum provider URL, contract addresses, and API keys). Refer to the `.env.example` file for the required variables.
5. Start the application by running the command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
6. Access the Whitelist dApp in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Register a new account or log in to an existing account.
2. Create a new whitelist by specifying the required criteria for inclusion.
3. Manage your whitelists by adding or removing addresses.
4. Verify whether an address is on a particular whitelist.
5. Track the modification history of each whitelist.

## Deployment

To deploy the Whitelist dApp to a live environment, you can follow the deployment instructions specific to your hosting provider. This typically involves deploying the React application and deploying the Solidity smart contracts to an Ethereum network.
