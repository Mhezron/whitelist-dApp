# Whitelist-dApp

Whitelist dApp gives access to the first 10 users for free.

The front-end is built on React and NextJS.

To build the smart contract we will be using Hardhat. Hardhat is an Ethereum development 

environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity.

We deploy the contract to the goerli network.

We use Quicknode to create a blockchain endpoint. Quicknode is a node provider that lets you 

connect to various different blockchains.

We will be using it to deploy our contract through Hardhat.

We use web3modal to connect our dApp to a wallet in this case we are going to use metamask.

We will now deploy your dApp on Vercel
